Question 1. What kind of information can you capture using a form? 
    Text, email, phone number, password, numbers, files, months, dates, color.
Question 2. What types of tags can you use to create forms?
    Form, label, input, button, textarea, select.
Question 3. What are the benefits/disadvantages of using some tags over others?
    Textarea is better than input when the user will input a large amount of text; however, input is better than
    textarea when the user enters a small amount of text, such as a single word. Buttons are better than the select tag when
    a few options are available, but when there are many items, such as ten, buttons make the screen look cluttered and a 
    select tag could be better.
Question 4. How do you start to programmatically use the data provided by the user?
    HTML does not transfer data; it merely displays data. Therefore, the first step to using the data provided by the user is 
    learning how to store such data. Javascript can be used to temporarily store the data on the client-side but a server-side
    database is recommended when data is needed to be stored for a long period of time.
